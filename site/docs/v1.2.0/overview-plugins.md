# Velero plugin system

Velero has a plugin system which allows integration with a variety of providers for backup storage and volume snapshot operations. 

During install, Velero requires that at least one plugin is added (with the `--plugins` flag). The plugin will be either of the type object store or volume snapshotter, or a plugin that contains both. An exception to this is that when the user is not configuring a backup storage location or a snapshot storage location at the time of install, this flag is optional.

Any plugin can be added after Velero has been installed by using the command `velero plugin add <registry/image:version>`. 

Example with a dockerhub image: `velero plugin add velero/velero-plugin-for-aws:v1.0.0`.

In the same way, any plugin can be removed by using the command `velero plugin remove <registry/image:version>`.

## Creating a new plugin

Anyone can add integrations for any platform to provide additional backup and volume storage without modifying the Velero codebase. To write a plugin for a new backup or volume storage platform, take a look at our [example repo][1] and at our documentation for [Custom plugins][2].

## Adding a new plugin

After you publish your plugin on your own repository, open a PR that adds a link to it under the appropriate list of [supported providers][3] page in our documentation.
